Search and show Photos on Pexels

Core Functionality

● Users can search for images using the Pexels Search API.
● Search results will be displayed in a LazyVerticalGrid with "scroll to end to Load more".
● Use FAB (Floating Action Button) to Refresh (easier to use than pull-down-to-refresh).
● Clicking on an image should open a detail view of the image.
● Support for pinch-to-zoom and drag gestures
● Full Responsive/Adaptive layouts to support different screen sizes
● Support for search history or recent searches
